                	<h2>Monkey D Luffy</h2>
            <p><strong>Monkey D. &quot;Straw Hat&quot; Luffy</strong>[1] (モンキー・D・ルフィ <em>Monkī Dī Rufi</em><strong>?</strong>) is a fictional character and the primary protagonist of the <em>One Piece</em> franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. He is introduced as a young boy whose body gains the properties of rubber after he inadvertently eats a supernatural fruit called the Gum-Gum Fruit.</p>
            <p>In <em>One Piece</em>, Luffy sails from the East Blue to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure One Piece to succeed Gol D. Roger as the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and he recruits members along his journey. He fights several antagonists, such as the World Government, during his travels. Luffy has a nonchalant demeanor but is quick to become serious whenever he senses that someone is in danger. Luffy is able to use the elasticity of his body to concentrate his strength and power for attacks, the most prominent being his signature Gum-Gum Pistol, in which Luffy slingshots his punches at opponents from a distance.</p>
            <p>As the protagonist, Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the anime series <em>One Piece</em>, as well as several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy has become one of the most recognizable and iconic anime characters. Outside of the <em>One Piece</em> franchise, Luffy has had an appearance in the crossover manga <em>Cross Epoch</em>. He has also been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in various special events throughout Japanese pop culture. Luffy's critical reception has been largely positive and he has been recognized as one of the greatest manga/anime characters of all time.</p>
            <p>Often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history, Hannibal would later be considered one of the greatest generals of antiquity, together with Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Scipio, and Pyrrhus of Epirus. Plutarch states that, when questioned by Scipio as to who was the greatest general, Hannibal is said to have replied either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself, or, according to another version of the event, Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself. Military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge once famously called Hannibal the <em>&quot;father of strategy&quot;</em>, because his greatest enemy, Rome, came to adopt elements of his military tactics in its own strategic arsenal. This praise has earned him a strong reputation in the modern world, and he was regarded as a great strategist by men like Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

            <h2>Appearances</h2>
            
            <p>Luffy first appears in the manga chapter &quot;Romance Dawn&quot; (Romance Dawn - 冒険の夜明 <em>Romance Dawn - Bōken no Yoake</em><strong>?</strong>), first published in Japan's <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> magazine on August 4, 1997. He first appears as a young boy living in Windmill Village who befriends the pirate &quot;Red-Haired&quot; Shanks, intending to become one himself. Before the series' narrative begins, he accidentally eats the Gum Gum Fruit, gaining rubber powers as a result and he is saved by Shanks from being eaten alive by a Sea King. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in search of a treasure known as the One Piece and to become King of the Pirates. Sailing alone, Luffy meets a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, the navigator and thief Nami, the cowardly marksman and liar Usopp, and the womanizing chef Sanji, who he invites to join his crew despite their initial objections. He also encounters and defeats several pirates in the East Blue, such as Buggy the Clown and the fishman Arlong. Luffy later accepts an offer to return the princess of Alabasta, Nefertari Vivi, safely into her homeland to stop a rebellion, incited by a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and leader of the crime syndicate Baroque Works, Sir Crocodile. Along the way, Luffy finds a reindeer doctor named Tony Tony Chopper in Drum Island. After defeating Crocodile, Luffy allows Crocodile's subordinate Nico Robin to become his ally.</p>
            <p>While visiting Skypiea, the crew gets drawn into a war between two races and Luffy defeats the god Eneru, ending the war. Luffy meets Navy Admiral Aokiji and is easily defeated. After learning about Robin's heritage, Luffy continues to face other enemies linked to her heritage, such as Franky, a cyborg who eventually becomes Luffy's ally and the intelligence agency Cipher Pol No. 9, who causes Luffy and his crew to save Robin at Enies Lobby. After their fight with CP9, Franky joins the crew. Entering the Florian Triangle, Luffy encounters a skeletal musician named Brook and, to return Brook's shadow, defeats the Warlord Gecko Moria. After releasing the rest of the island's prisoners, Brook becomes a member of Luffy's crew. The crew goes to the Sabaody Archipelago, and have Silvers Rayleigh coat the <em>Thousand Sunny</em> to enter the second half of the Grand Line. However, Luffy's encounter with Admiral Kizaru and the Warlord Bartholomew Kuma results in Luffy and his crew being sent to separate parts of the world.</p>
            <p>Stranded on Amazon Lily, an island ruled by the Warlord Boa Hancock, Luffy moves Hancock with his bravery and selflessness. Hancock falls in love with Luffy and helps bring him to the underground prison Impel Down to rescue his brother Portgas D. Ace from being executed. Luffy breaks into the prison and meets previous foes as well as new allies, such as the Warlord Jimbei. After Luffy liberates the prisoners, they arrive at Marineford and Luffy is drawn into a war between the navy and Whitebeard's pirate crews.However, Ace saves Luffy at the cost of his own life, and Luffy and Jimbei are evacuated from Marineford by Trafalgar Law. Returning to Amazon Lily, Luffy remembers how he first met Ace: after Shanks leaves Windmill Village, Luffy's grandfather leaves him in bandit Curly Dadan's care. He befriends Ace and Sabo during this time who become his bond brothers; however, Sabo is killed by one of the Celestial Dragons. After returning to Marineford to send a hidden message to his crew, Luffy undergoes training with Rayleigh on the island Ruskaina in an effort to become stronger.</p>
            <p>Two years later, Luffy regroups with the Straw Hats, but the crew gets separated again for a short period while sailing to Fishman Island. Luffy and the others meet Jimbei and the island's princess Shirahoshi, and are drawn into a battle for the island against fishman Hody Jones. Luffy and the crew, along with Jimbei, eventually regroup and conceive a plan to defeat Hody and his henchmen. Following Hody's defeat, Luffy retrieves the stolen treasure from the rookie pirate Caribou and starts a feud with Big Mam. The crew enters the New World, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin disembark on Punk Hazard but are soon captured by Caesar Clown, a jealous rival of the scientist Vegapunk. Luffy and his crew organize an alliance with Law to defeat Caesar. Eventually, Luffy defeats Caesar after learning about his history.</p>

                        <h2>Creation and Conception</h2>
            
            <p>When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he wanted to strive for a &quot;manliness&quot; quality similar to those found in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> series created by Akira Toriyama. To make the readers relax without being stressed out, Oda added rubber powers to Luffy for a comical effect Oda tries to draw Luffy very straightforward about what he wants to be and how he feels.</p>
            <p>The devil fruit that Luffy gained his abilities from was originally called the Gomu no Mi (ゴムの実, lit. fruit of rubber), but after the editor pointed out that a real rubber fruit existed, the name was changed to the Gomu Gomu no Mi (ゴムゴムの実<strong>?</strong>, lit. fruit of rubber rubber, renamed &quot;Gum Gum Fruit&quot; in the English adaptations).</p>
